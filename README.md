# MT-MemOverload (Multithreaded RAM and page file overloading malware)
This is a piece of harmless malware that will fill up your RAM and page file until your computer is rendered useless, forcing you to do hard shutdown to get things back to normal. It is also multithreaded for maximal speed so you have less of a chance to kill the task before it renders the system unusable. Thread count is determined based on your CPU core count. If you have a non-HT CPU (or if HT is turned off in the BIOS), the thread count will be the number of cores. On an HT enabled CPU, the thread count will be twice the core count.

Edit: While the initial variant with a bug that prevented multi-threading did manage to freeze my system, I don't know what happened but when I fixed the multi-threading, some weird mess happens with the memory management on Windows where it purges most of the used memory and page file space and refills, over and over again. Not sure if the memory manager has some smart feature to combat this type of malware or of otherwise figured out what I am doing. On Linux it just goes into a "clean" fill-purge loop.
