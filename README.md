# MT-MemOverload (Multithreaded RAM and page file overloading malware)
This is a piece of harmless malware that will fill up your RAM and page file until your computer is rendered useless, forcing you to do hard shutdown to get things back to normal. It is also multithreaded for maximal speed so you have less of a chance to kill the task before it renders the system unusable. Thread count is determined based on your CPU core count. If you have a non-HT CPU (or if HT is turned off in the BIOS), the thread count will be the number of cores. On an HT enabled CPU, the thread count will be twice the core count.
